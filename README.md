# Projet Devops

A brief description

So this project is about installing two virtual machines and installe inside them docker, docker compose, and run a small application inside them using ansible

## Roadmap of using this project

- I installed Vagrant from this link for windows https://www.vagrantup.com/ and after that verifie the installation using this command inside the cmd.

```bash
    vagrant -v
```

- I created a folder called projet_devops. you can name it whatever you want.

- I created a file called " Vagrantfile ". See the configuration about the two virtual machines inside it.

- I installed Git to use the command line for windows from this link https://git-scm.com/downloads

- So now use Git and go inside the the foldor that you created.

```bash
  cd {your_folder_path}
```

- Verifie that you have Vagrantfile and all the configuration are ok.
```bash
  ls
  cat Vagrantfile
```
- now use the following command to create the two virtual machines.

```bash
  vagrant up
```
-
